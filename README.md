### Problem Statement

There aren't many straightforward rankings for budget videogames. There are of course the current best games,
current budget games, best classic games, best games for different genres, etc. Is it possible to rank games based on
their value, such as rating over price? Can there be multiple rankings on different parameters? Can it be programmatic?
